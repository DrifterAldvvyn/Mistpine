[00:55.67] Closed doors brings open minds (and I don't want to see you)
[01:02.72] See you smile inside (and I don't want to know you)
[01:09.49] Faces and I've fallen (and I don't want to hear you)
[01:16.64] Wonder why I'm here now
[01:26.02] In asylum
[01:32.97] Don't you see?
[01:39.93] In asylum
