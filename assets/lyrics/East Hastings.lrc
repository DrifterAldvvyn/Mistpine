[00:03.42] God love this country, the United States, the world
[00:07.73] And all the millionaires
[00:10.24] If money could buy happiness, my love, then we'll have it
[00:15.53] But praise God
[00:17.79] It's only salvation, it's only Jesus Christ
[00:22.49] Holy Hallelujah, holy Jesus Christ (Nah, I'm not up for this)
[00:26.89] God give us peace, happiness, and love (I believe in Jesus!)
[00:32.06] And joy in our souls
[00:35.36] No matter what we have, no matter the money
[00:38.33] No matter the riches of the world
[00:40.74] It cannot buy, it cannot buy what we wantâ€” Thank you
[00:48.94] But the price of not realizing what we want
[00:52.52] And what we need is the love of Jesus Christ
[00:56.67] With the love of Jesus Christ
[00:59.68] Hallelujah
[01:00.70] I don't care what you have in the world
[01:03.14] For if you don't have Jesus, then we'd all be lost
[01:08.20] We don't have the happiness and joy
[01:10.48] If we don't have Jesus Christ, we don't have nothing
[01:14.06] Nothing is alright in our life
[01:16.77] Nothing-nothing, nothing-nothing!
[01:21.37] If we don't have Jesus in our life
[01:25.27]
